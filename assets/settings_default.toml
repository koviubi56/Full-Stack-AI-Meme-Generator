# This is NOT the individual meme image prompt. Here you can change this to tell it the general style or qualities to apply to all memes, such as using dark humor, surreal humor, wholesome, etc. 
# Default: "You will create funny memes that are clever and original, and not cliche or lame."
basic_instructions = "You will create funny memes that are clever and original, and not cliche or lame."

# You can use this to tell it how to generate the image itself. You can specify a style such as being a photograph, drawing, etc, or something more specific such as always use cats in the pictures.
# Default: "The images should be photographic."
